## Command Line Tools Renaissance

Random voices from the internet (2022-01-23)

> I love the general renaissance of terminal UI tools we are seeing in the last
> few years. I can't quite put my finger on what I like about it so much.

> [...] I can. Doesn't require a 1.5GB build directory to make a 500MB binary that

There is a certain aura of efficiency around tools which fit into a 24x80 grid.

### Mergestat

Actually, is it true that 80% of the changes to a project are made in 20% of
the files? Let's run some SQL over a git repository ...


```sql
$ cat authors.sql
SELECT author_name, count(*)
FROM commits -- replace repo
WHERE parents < 2 -- ignore merge commits
GROUP BY author_name ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT 20
```

```shell
$ cat authors.sql | \
    mergestat -r ~/code/rclone/rclone/ -f tsv-noheader | \
    column -ts $'\t'

Most modified files in a repo:

Our question (using [rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/) repo):

* commit last year

```
$ git log --pretty=format:"%H" --since 1.year.ago | wc -l
712
```

* commits in the **top 20** most touched files

```
$ mergestat -f tsv-noheader < modified.sql | \
    column -ts $'\t'  |
    awk '{print $2}' |
    paste -sd+ |
    bc -l
287
```

Total number of files in the repo: 2087. **So 40% of the commits happen in less
than 1% of the files**.
